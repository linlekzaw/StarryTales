Overview üåå
CosmoQuest is an immersive and interactive web app designed to take users on a journey through the history of the universe. Starting from the Big Bang, users can watch the formation of galaxies, stars, clusters, and nebulae unfold in real-time. The app allows users to pause the cosmic timeline, select individual celestial objects, and explore detailed information about them. It‚Äôs both a learning tool and a visual representation of the universe‚Äôs grand evolution, perfect for astronomy enthusiasts and curious minds alike.

The primary goal of CosmoQuest is to provide an intuitive, fun, and educational experience that helps users visualize the scale and complexity of the universe, while also offering rich data about cosmic entities.

Features ü™ê
Interactive Cosmic Timeline: Experience the timeline of the universe's evolution from the Big Bang to present day. Users can control the progression, pause, or resume the simulation.

Object Interaction: Select and interact with celestial objects (galaxies, stars, nebulae, clusters) to get detailed descriptions, images, and data.

3D Visualization: With the help of 3D rendering, explore the universe in a visually compelling way. Move through space and zoom in on objects as they form.

Data on Celestial Objects: Each object in the system is backed by real astronomical data (such as size, composition, distance, and more) to provide an educational experience.

User Control: Pause the formation process at any point and select individual stars, galaxies, or other objects for more information.

Technology Used üíª
HTML5: Structure and content of the web app.
CSS3: Styles and layouts for an appealing and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles user interaction, timeline control, and real-time updates to the visualizations.
Three.js: For rendering 3D objects and the universe simulation.
JSON: For storing and retrieving detailed data about celestial objects.
GitHub Pages: Used to host the web application, making it accessible online.
